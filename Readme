Project Introduction:
We have Medicare Provider data for all the Prescribers located in the US. The data files are in csv and parquet format which are:
    1. EXTRACTED 
    2. TRANSFORMED
    3. LOADED
into their respective destinations.

After successful ETL process, we build two analytical reports on the clean data to find out decision driving insights.
